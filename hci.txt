Leap motion vs Kinect

Kinect is a sensor used especially for gaming, that too with a gaming console. Microsoft did release a windows version of it but considering it's capabilities, Gaming and Fitness are the most appropriate areas where Kinect would fit than applications. Kinect allows interaction in a range of 0.4 to 4 meters. It does both, full and partial skeletal tracking, depth sensing and audio tracking as well. The upcoming version of Kinect also measures heart rate, recognizes expressions, tracks 6 users at a time, determines forces at various joints of body and does a muscle simulation.


Kinect - Most powerful, most popular, more games and apps, better suited for Console games and Fitness purpose, Bigger in size than other sensors and hence less portable.


The Leap Motion is meant for use much closer to the user than the Kinect. While the Kinect has a usable range from about 1.2 m to 3.5 m from the sensor, the Leap Motion has a range of about 1 to 20 inches (though it has a 150 degree field of view). It also has a much higher precision than the Kinect, with the ability to resolve movements of 1/100 mm (vs. the Kinect’s 1.3 mm resolution). This means it is more suited to the role of a computer input device than the Kinect, as it has a range that is more conducive to use at desk-range. Its high resolution allows for the possibility of handwriting recognition, virtual keyboards, and more precise gesture-based controls. However, it cannot track the entire body, like the Kinect does; rather, it (more precisely) tracks a smaller portion of the body (usually the hands and arms).

Leap Motion - Most accurate, Embedded in PCs and tablets, better suited for PC games and apps, limited capability, awkward placement.
